<p>It's a radical new approach to Distributed programming. It distribute the multiple copies of data on nodes when data is stored and run computation where data is present. Data is replicated for increased availability and reliability. </p>

<p>In Hadoop, applications are written in high level code. Nodes in hadoop cluster talks to each other as little as possible as data is distributed on nodes in advance. </p>

<p>It is scalable and fault tolerant.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adding nodes in Hadoop cluster adds capacity proportionally.</li>
<li>Increasing load results in a graceful decline in performance and not failure of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Node failure is inevitable but hadoop handles it efficiently and system continues to function. In hadoop master re-assign 
tasks to different node. As data is replicated on multiple nodes so no loss of data and as soon as node recover it will 
join cluster automatically.</li>
</ul>
