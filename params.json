{"name":"Hadoop - An Elephant","tagline":"Hadoop","body":"## Why Hadoop?\r\n\r\nTraditionally, computation has been bound to processors as there is a small amount of data and we used to perform lots of computation on it. Then bigger computers came into picture with fast processor and more memory but these also not able to meet expectations.\r\n\r\nWe keep on increasing system capabilities or we can say we keep on expanding vertically which is not able to suffice our demands of complex computing with large chunk of data. Then concept of Distributed programming came into picture or we can say horizontal expansion which involves multiple machines to process data or to compute on large chunks with data efficiently but with few challenges.\r\n\r\n1. Keeping\"data\"and\"processes\"in\"sync\"\r\n1. Finite\"bandwidth\"\"\r\n1. Partial \"failures\"\r\n\r\nAlso, traditionally in distributed computing, data is stored in a stored location and data is copied to processors at runtime. To avoid all these challenges, **\"Hadoop\"** came.\r\n\r\n##What Hadoop do for us?\r\nIt's a radical new approach to Distributed programming. It distribute the multiple copies of data on nodes when data is stored and run computation where data is present. Data is replicated for increased availability and reliability. \r\n\r\nIn Hadoop, applications are written in high level code. Nodes in hadoop cluster talks to each other as little as possible as data is distributed on nodes in advance. \r\n\r\nIt is scalable and fault tolerant.\r\n\r\n**Scalability**\r\n* Adding nodes in Hadoop cluster adds capacity proportionally.\r\n* Increasing load results in a graceful decline in performance and not failure of the system.\r\n\r\n**Fault Tolerance**\r\n* Node failure is inevitable but hadoop handles it efficiently and system continues to function. In hadoop master re-assign \r\n  tasks to different node. As data is replicated on multiple nodes so no loss of data and as soon as node recover it will \r\n  join cluster automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Hadoop?\r\nApache Hadoop is a set of algorithms (an open-source software framework written in Java) for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets (Big Data) on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures (of individual machines, or racks of machines) are commonplace and thus should be automatically handled in software by the framework.\r\n\r\nThe core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part (Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)) and a processing part (MapReduce). \r\n\r\nHadoop splits files into large blocks (default 64MB or 128MB) and distributes the blocks amongst the nodes in the cluster. To process the data, Hadoop Map/Reduce transfers code (specifically Jar files) to nodes that have the required data, which the nodes then process in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality to allow the data to be processed faster and more efficiently via distributed processing than by using a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are connected via high-speed networking.\r\n\r\nThe Hadoop framework itself is mostly written in the Java programming language, with some native code in C and command line utilities written as shell-scripts. For end-users, though MapReduce Java code is common, any programming language can be used with \"Hadoop Streaming\" to implement the \"map\" and \"reduce\" parts of the user's program.[11] Other related projects expose other higher level user interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:\r\n\r\n* **Hadoop Common** – contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules.\r\n* **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** – a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.\r\n* **Hadoop YARN** – a resource-management platform responsible for managing compute resources in clusters and using them for scheduling of users' applications.\r\n* **Hadoop MapReduce** – a programming model for large scale data processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hadoop Architecture\r\n\r\nHadoop consists of the Hadoop Common package, which provides filesystem and OS level abstractions, a MapReduce engine (either MapReduce/MR1 or YARN/MR2) and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The Hadoop Common package contains the necessary Java ARchive (JAR) files and scripts needed to start Hadoop. The package also provides source code, documentation, and a contribution section that includes projects from the Hadoop Community.\r\n\r\n## Hadoop Cluster\r\n\r\nA small Hadoop cluster includes a single master and multiple worker nodes. The master node consists of a JobTracker, TaskTracker, NameNode and DataNode. A slave or worker node acts as both a DataNode and TaskTracker, though it is possible to have data-only worker nodes and compute-only worker nodes. \r\n\r\nThese are normally used only in nonstandard applications. Hadoop requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or higher. The standard startup and shutdown scripts require that Secure Shell (ssh) be set up between nodes in the cluster.\r\n\r\nIn a larger cluster, the HDFS is managed through a dedicated NameNode server to host the file system index, and a secondary NameNode that can generate snapshots of the namenode's memory structures, thus preventing file-system corruption and reducing loss of data. Similarly, a standalone JobTracker server can manage job scheduling. In clusters where the Hadoop MapReduce engine is deployed against an alternate file system, the NameNode, secondary NameNode, and DataNode architecture of HDFS are replaced by the file-system-specific equivalents.\r\n\r\n## Hadoop Distributed File System\r\n\r\nThe Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is a distributed, scalable, and portable file-system written in Java for the Hadoop framework. A Hadoop cluster has nominally a single namenode plus a cluster of datanodes, although redundancy options are available for the namenode due to its criticality. Each datanode serves up blocks of data over the network using a block protocol specific to HDFS. The file system uses TCP/IP sockets for communication. Clients use remote procedure call (RPC) to communicate between each other.\r\n\r\nHDFS stores large files (typically in the range of gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes) across multiple machines. It achieves reliability by replicating the data across multiple hosts, and hence theoretically does not require RAID storage on hosts (but to increase I/O performance some RAID configurations are still useful). Before continue with our discussion on HDFS let us clear our views on RAID. \r\n\r\n**What is RAID?**- RAID (originally redundant array of inexpensive disks; now commonly redundant array of independent disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple disk drive components into a logical unit for the purposes of data redundancy or performance improvement.\r\n\r\nData is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the specific level of redundancy and performance required. The different schemes or architectures are named by the word RAID followed by a number (e.g. RAID 0, RAID 1). Each scheme provides a different balance between the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity. RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable (sector) read errors, as well as whole disk failure.\r\n\r\nContinuing our discussion on HDFS, with default replication value, 3, data is stored on three nodes: two on the same rack, and one on a different rack. Data nodes can talk to each other to rebalance data, to move copies around, and to keep the replication of data high. HDFS is not fully POSIX-compliant, because the requirements for a POSIX file-system differ from the target goals for a Hadoop application. The tradeoff of not having a fully POSIX-compliant file-system is increased performance for data throughput and **support for non-POSIX operations such as Append.**\r\n\r\nHDFS added the high-availability capabilities, letting the main metadata server (the NameNode) fail over manually to a backup. The HDFS file system includes a so-called secondary namenode, a misleading name that some might incorrectly interpret as a backup namenode for when the primary namenode goes offline. In fact, the secondary namenode regularly connects with the primary namenode and builds snapshots of the primary namenode's directory information, which the system then saves to local or remote directories. These checkpointed images can be used to restart a failed primary namenode without having to replay the entire journal of file-system actions, then to edit the log to create an up-to-date directory structure. Because the namenode is the single point for storage and management of metadata, it can become a bottleneck for supporting a huge number of files, especially a large number of small files. HDFS Federation, a new addition, aims to tackle this problem to a certain extent by allowing multiple namespaces served by separate namenodes.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of using HDFS is data awareness between the job tracker and task tracker. The job tracker schedules map or reduce jobs to task trackers with an awareness of the data location. For example: if node A contains data (x,y,z) and node B contains data (a,b,c), the job tracker schedules node B to perform map or reduce tasks on (a,b,c) and node A would be scheduled to perform map or reduce tasks on (x,y,z). This reduces the amount of traffic that goes over the network and prevents unnecessary data transfer. When Hadoop is used with other file systems, this advantage is not always available. This can have a significant impact on job-completion times, which has been demonstrated when running data-intensive jobs.\r\n\r\nHDFS was designed for mostly immutable files and may not be suitable for systems requiring concurrent write-operations.\r\n\r\nHDFS can be mounted directly with a Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) virtual file system on Linux and some other Unix systems.\r\n\r\nFile access can be achieved through the native Java API, the Thrift API to generate a client in the language of the users' choosing (C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, Smalltalk, and OCaml), the command-line interface, browsed through the HDFS-UI webapp over HTTP, or via 3rd-party network client libraries.\r\n\r\n**Other file systems:**\r\n\r\nHadoop works directly with any distributed file system that can be mounted by the underlying operating system simply by using a file:// URL; however, this comes at a price: the loss of locality. To reduce network traffic, Hadoop needs to know which servers are closest to the data; this is information that Hadoop-specific file system bridges can provide.\r\n\r\nList of supported file systems bundled with Apache Hadoop were:\r\n\r\n* **HDFS** - Hadoop's own rack-aware file system. This is designed to scale to tens of petabytes of storage and runs on top of the file systems of the underlying operating systems.\r\n* **FTP File system** - Stores all its data on remotely accessible FTP servers.\r\n* **Amazon S3 file system** - This is targeted at clusters hosted on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud server-on-demand infrastructure. There is no rack-awareness in this file system, as it is all remote.\r\n* **Windows Azure Storage Blobs (WASB) file system** - WASB, an extension on top of HDFS, allows distributions of Hadoop to access data in Azure blob stores without moving the data permanently into the cluster.\r\n\r\n## MapReduce Engine - JobTracker and TaskTracker\r\n\r\nAbove the file systems comes the MapReduce engine, which consists of one JobTracker, to which client applications submit MapReduce jobs. The JobTracker pushes work out to available TaskTracker nodes in the cluster, striving to keep the work as close to the data as possible. With a rack-aware file system, the JobTracker knows which node contains the data, and which other machines are nearby. If the work cannot be hosted on the actual node where the data resides, priority is given to nodes in the same rack. This reduces network traffic on the main backbone network. If a TaskTracker fails or times out, that part of the job is rescheduled. The TaskTracker on each node spawns off a separate Java Virtual Machine process to prevent the TaskTracker itself from failing if the running job crashes the JVM. A heartbeat is sent from the TaskTracker to the JobTracker every few minutes to check its status. The Job Tracker and TaskTracker status and information is exposed by Jetty and can be viewed from a web browser\r\n\r\nKnown limitations of this approach are:\r\n\r\nThe allocation of work to TaskTrackers is very simple. Every TaskTracker has a number of available slots (such as \"4 slots\"). Every active map or reduce task takes up one slot. The Job Tracker allocates work to the tracker nearest to the data with an available slot. There is no consideration of the current system load of the allocated machine, and hence its actual availability.\r\nIf one TaskTracker is very slow, it can delay the entire MapReduce job – especially towards the end of a job, where everything can end up waiting for the slowest task. With speculative execution enabled, however, a single task can be executed on multiple slave nodes.\r\n\r\n**Scheduling**\r\nBy default Hadoop uses FIFO, and optionally 5 scheduling priorities to schedule jobs from a work queue. In version 0.19 the job scheduler was refactored out of the JobTracker, while adding the ability to use an alternate scheduler (such as the Fair scheduler or the Capacity scheduler).\r\n\r\n##What's common across Hadoop problems?\r\nIt's nature of data :  Volume , Velocity and Variety.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
