Most Hadoop Ecosystem Projects are Apache projects or Apache Incubator projects and may be:
* Built on HDFS and MapReduce - Pig, Hive.
* Built on just HDFS - Impala by Cloudera.
* Designed to integrate with or support Hadoop.

###Hive and Pig
* Both languages are used for querying and manipulating data.
* Interpreter runs on a client machine.
* Turns queries to MapReduce jobs, which is further submitted to cluster.

**Hive** - It's similar to SQL.

**Pig** - It's dataflow scripting language.

###Impala
* High performance SQL engine for vast amounts of data.
* Similar query language to "HiveQL".
* 10 to 50+ times faster than Hive, Pig, or MapReduce as it runs directly on Hadoop clusters and do not use MapReduce.
* Use data stored in HDFS.
* It's developed by Cloudera and 100%"open source, released under the  Apache software license.

###Flume
* Flume imports data into HDFS as it is generated usually log files from a Web Server, instead of batch processing it later.

###Sqoop - "SQL to Hadoop"
* Sqoo transfers data between RDBMS and HDFS. It does this very efficiently via a Map/only MapReduce job.
* It supports JDBC, ODBC, and several specific databases.


###OOzie
* It's a workflow engine for MapReduce jobs and also defines dependencies between jobs.
* Oozie server submits the jobs to the server in the correct sequence.

###HBase
* HBase is the Hadoop column oriented database.
* Its a "NoSQL" datastore and can store massive amount of data.
* have high write throughput and scale to hundreds of thousands o inserts per second.
* Handles sparse data well with no wasted spaces for empty columns in a row.
* It have a limited access model and optimized for lookup of a row by key rather than full queries.
* No support for transactions - Single row operations only.

###Mahout - An Elephant Rider
* Mahout is a Machine Learning library written in Java.
* Used for Collaborative filtering (recommendations), Clustering (finding naturally occurring groupings in data), Classification (determining whether new data fits a category).
